This is my custom gridclass TUI """""library""""". Its a way of putting objects on the windows command prompt screen and manipulating them withing a grid environment.

The library consists of 3 classes: 
-   the grid class, which is the environment where objects can be placed, 
-   the obj class, representing the fundemental object with an (x,y) coordinate, name, symbol and colour, and
-    the bundle class which represents a group of objs that can be manipulated at once.
